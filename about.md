This site is a quick sketch to follow along with the [*Quantum Field Theory for the Gifted Amateur*](http://www.amazon.com/Quantum-Field-Theory-Gifted-Amateur/dp/019969933X) text by Lancaster and Blundell, published by [Oxford](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/quantum-field-theory-for-the-gifted-amateur-9780199699339?cc=us&lang=en&).

I mostly produced this site to make up an excuse to read the book, and an excuse to learn some more web programming. Let me know if you spot an error in either one.
